Recognizing that some critical aspects of modern society can never be fully decarbonised,
a shift to a net zero-carbon economy will necessarily require some level of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).
Many approaches to CCS have been proposed, including [pumping CO2 into oil wells](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583618304857)
and [trapping it as chalk precipitate](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6291/1312).
Perhaps the simplest and least controversial way to accomplish this task is to [plant trees](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01026-8).

To give an idea of the scale involved, the median carbon sequestration potential of an agroforestry system, which combines agriculture and forestry, is estimated to be [about 95 metric tons (T) per hectare](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880903001385) and,
if left undisturbed, can [trap this CO2 for decades](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12914) or even centuries.

This is roughly the equivalent of the emissions from [10 UK households in one year](https://www.theccc.org.uk).
Recent work suggests that the earth has the potential to [sustain a trillion more trees](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76) planted
in approximately 900 million hectares of currently denuded land, with a carbon sequestration potential
of 205 GT, which is comparable to anthropogenic emissions of [1500 GT to date](https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/biblio/dataset/1389323).
Thus, technological interventions to promote reforestation are an attractive approach to mitigate anthropogenic climate change.

In addition to carbon sequestration, forests provide many other benefits both to the environment and to humans. Environmental benefits
include air purification, flood prevention, slope stabilization, and increasing bio-diversity. Human benefits include
jobs in forestry and agroforestry, improving public health, providing food (such as chestnuts), and providing a source of sustainable building materials.
For these reasons, reforestation has become a topic of great current interest, with the World Economic Forum announcing
in January 2020 an initiative to plant [1 trillion trees](TODO)

Similarly, the Plant for the Planet initiative also aims to plant 1 trillion trees~\cite{pftp}
with more than 13.5 billion planted so far.
However, reforestation is not simply a matter of
planting saplings or seeds in the ground~\cite{lamb_large-scale_2014}.
